            <h2 id="What-is-an-IP-address?">What is an IP address?</h2>
            <p>An IP address is a unique address that represent a unique device on a local network or on the internet. IP address refers to internet protocol and there are rules regarding to the IP nomenclature and the for the behavior of it. IP addresses are crucial in data transferring one device to the another as it stand as the identifier for the particular device in a large network. IP address contain the location and it makes easier for the communication process. In this world of devices connected to internet, there should a way to differentiate the devices to pass the data and information without any disturbances. </p>

            <h2 id="What-is-IPV4?">What is IPV4?</h2>
            <p>IPV4 is known as internet protocol version 4. It is the backbone of the networking science which make possible to connect the user to the internet via an electronic device. When a device wants to access the internet, it assigns to a numerical code named IP address such as 255.255.255.254. In here data packet is the smallest part of data which transfer between 2 or more devices via a relevant network to communicate among themselves.</p>

            <h2 id="What-is-an-IPV6?">What is an IPV6?</h2>
            <p>IPv6 is the next-generation Internet Protocol (IP) standard that will eventually replace IPv4, which is still used by many Internet services. In order to communicate with other devices, each and every computer, mobile phone, and other device connected to the Internet requires an IP address. 
              IPv6 was first published as a draught standard in 1998, and then as an Internet Standard in 2017. Eight groups of four hexadecimal numbers are used to represent it, with colons separating each group. It also improves and implements hierarchical address allocation methods, extending the routing capabilities and limiting the size of routing tables. A few key aspects of IPv6 are listed below:
          </p>
          <ol>
                  <li>It allows for the storage of an endless number of IP addresses and is a good choice for interacting with neighbouring nodes.</li>
                  <li>It has a lot of features for both state-full and state-less settings.</li>
                  <li>It improves the infrastructure for hierarchical addressing.</li>
              </ol>
